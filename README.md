# Chipotle Marketing Analysis
I analyzed Chipotle survey data to group individuals with similar traits into distinct categories using K-Means clustering to inform marketing, menu planning, and customer experience.

Here is the [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/shayan-g/Chipotle-Marketing-Analysis/blob/main/Chipotle%20Questionnaire%20and%20Data%20Key.pdf) for those that are interested in how the data was collected as well as other relevant information.

## Purpose
- Identify meaningful customer segments from survey responses.
- Understand what diners value (price, taste, health, convenience, variety) alongside demographics.
- Translate insights into actionable recommendations.

## What this repository includes
- A notebook with the full workflow: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, clustering, visualization, and segment profiling.
- Visuals generated in-notebook (ex. null-value heatmap and preference comparisons).
- Recommendation summary for discovered segments.

## Approach Overview
1. Standardize survey fields and encode categorical responses.
2. Apply K-Means to derive four customer segments.
3. Profile segments using preferences and demographics, then convert insights into targeted recommendations.
